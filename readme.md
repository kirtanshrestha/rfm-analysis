# 🧮 RFM Analysis — Customer Segmentation using Python

This project performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
RFM is a popular marketing technique used to identify valuable customers, design loyalty programs, and optimize marketing strategies.

## 📊 What is RFM?

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often they purchase  
- **Monetary (M):** How much they spend  

By combining these metrics, customers are grouped into meaningful segments such as *loyal*, *new*, *at-risk*, and *lost* customers.
